## Man in space

{{<img src="/images/maninspace.png" alt="Man in space gameplay" caption="Man in space gameplay">}}

I released a game on Gamejolt with [Alexandrum](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandrum) a while ago: [_Man in space_](https://sites.google.com/view/man-in-space).
Unfortunately, I never got around to releasing it because I didn't know that 
much about game development at the time and immediately took on a project that was too big for me.

*Map Reader* is a game in Unity that I'm working on with a friend.

It is currently in a very early stage
of development and I'm currently thinking about how the gameplay should work.

What is certain at the moment is that adventure and strategy will be an important part of the game and that it will be in a world of Dungeons and Dragons and that it will be a board type game.

This is how the story begins:

>_You begin the game with you waking up with the sound of swords
clashing. Your brother is calling you outside of the caravan seeking
your help to fight. A horde of goblins was attacking the merchants you
and brother were traveling with. Surpassed by the amount of goblins,
your brother got hurt badly and after giving you the letter of admission
died in the militia of Daggerford. To avenge and honor him, you enter
the militia. Your first mission is to destroy goblin camp that are doing
raids on the road going to Waterdeep._
