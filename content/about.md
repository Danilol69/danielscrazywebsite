Hi, I'm Daniel.

I'm a **web and game developer**. I think having a website is cool, so I made one to post my thoughts on topics like music, books or hobbies. This site is also heavily inspired by [Eric Murphy](https://ericmurphy.xyz/). Check out his stuff if you want.

## My favorite games

{{<img src="/images/fearstofathom.jpg" alt="Fears to Fathom: Ironbark Lookout" link="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506160/Fears_to_Fathom__Ironbark_Lookout/" caption="Fears to Fathom: Ironbark Lookout">}}

1. Firewatch
2. Fears to Fathom
3. The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (the most nostalgic one)
4. At Dead of Night
5. Portal 2

I believe that each of these games kind of has a unique vibe and that's why I like them so much.

## My favorite movies/shows

1. Kingsman 1 & 2
2. Gravity Falls
3. WALL-E
4. Free Guy
5. The Walking Dead

I'll probably add some more content here later.
