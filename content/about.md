Hi, I'm Daniel.

I'm a **web and game developer**. I think having a website is cool, so I made one to post my thoughts on topics like music, books or hobbies.

## My favorite games

{{< image src="/images/fearstofathom.jpg" alt="Fears to Fathom" >}}

1. Fears to Fathom
2. Firewatch
3. The Legend of Zelda:A Link Between Worlds (the most nostalgic one)
4. At Dead of Night
5. Portal 2

I believe that each of these games kind of has a unique vibe and that's why I like them so much.

## My favorite movies/shows

{{< image src="/images/kingsman.jpg" alt="Kingsman: The Secret Service" >}}

1. Kingsman 1 & 2
2. Gravity Falls
3. WALL-E
4. Free Guy
5. The Walking Dead

I'll probably add some more content here later.
